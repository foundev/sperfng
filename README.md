# sperfng

Second generation attempt at sperf using the go programming langauge again.

## Why rewrite

Well it may not be a rewrite but may just exist alongside for a long time, and overtime I may move more library code to go, or do some half and half thing like what happens with
a lot of Python packages that are performance sensitive and publish this as an optional shared library to improve performance of the pure python version of sperf. We will see.

## What can it do today

not a lot, but I will be adding to it as time goes on.

## How to build

Use go 1.16

`make`

## How to test

`make test`
